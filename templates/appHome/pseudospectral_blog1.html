  <p>
    My graduate research at BYU relied on good boundary value problem (BVP) solvers. So I had the chance to review a lot of what was already implemented in Python, and build several of my own implementations. One approach that I've really enjoyed learning about is the pseudospectral method. This blog post will focus on approximating functions with Chebychev polynomials. I plan to eventually discuss a pseudospectral BVP solver.
  </p>

  <p> Any smooth function defined on $[-1,1]$ can be expanded as a infinite series of Chebychev polynomials
    $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n T_n(x),$
    where the Chebychev polynomials are defined by a recurrence relation: $T_0 = 1$, $T_1 = x$, with $T_{n+1} = 2xT_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x)$. In numerical calculations we always truncate the sum at some degree $N$: $f \approx \sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n T_n(x)$.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another way to approximate $f$ is to use polynomial interpolation. Polynomial interpolation has problems if an evenly spaced set of grid points is used. A much better set of grid points is the Gauss-Lobatto grid, which consists of the Chebychev extremum plus the endpoints $\pm 1$.
  </p>


  <p>
    Let's approximate the function $f(x) = x \cos(5x^2 + 2x +1)$. We begin by plotting the function:
  </p>

  <pre style="margin=0 0; border:0 0; padding:0 0 0 0; ">
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.interpolate import BarycentricInterpolator
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    def f(x):
        return x*np.cos(5*x**2 + 2*x + 1)

    X = np.linspace(-1,1,200)
    plt.plot(X,f(X),'-k')
    plt.show()
  </pre>

  </div>

  <p>
    The Chebychev extrema plus endpoints grid can be calculated quickly. We use SciPy's <span style="font-family: monospace;">BarycentricInterpolator</span> to plot the interpolating polynomials over grids of increasing size:
  </p>
  <pre style="margin=0 0; border:0 0; padding:0 0 0 0; ">
    N = 5
    x1 = np.cos((np.pi/N)*np.linspace(0,N,N+1))
    interp = BarycentricInterpolator(x1,f(x1))
    u1 = interp.__call__(X)

    N = 10
    x2 = np.cos((np.pi/N)*np.linspace(0,N,N+1))
    interp = BarycentricInterpolator(x2,f(x2))
    u2 = interp.__call__(X)

    N = 15
    x3 = np.cos((np.pi/N)*np.linspace(0,N,N+1))
    interp = BarycentricInterpolator(x3,f(x3))
    u3 = interp.__call__(X)

    plt.plot(X,f(X),'-k',label="$f$")
    plt.plot(x1,f(x1),'*g')
    plt.plot(X,u1,'-g',label="$p_5$")

    plt.plot(x2,f(x2),'*b')
    plt.plot(X,u2,'-b',label="$p_{10}$")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
  </pre>

  <div class="imagediv">

  </div>

  <p>
    The errors in these approximating polynomials get small remarkably fast:
  </p>
  <pre style="margin=0 0; border:0 0; padding:0 0 0 0; ">
    plt.plot(X,(u1-f(X)),'-g',label="$E_5$")
    plt.plot(X,(u2-f(X)),'-b',label="$E_{10}$")
    plt.plot(X,(u3-f(X)),'-r',label="$E_{15}$")
    plt.ylabel("Error")
    plt.xlabel("$x$")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
  </pre>

    Math Details: Is Interpolation Safe?

  <!-- Can be used to find coefficients of truncated Chebychev expansion of $f$! (Well, almost. It's close, because the Gauss-Lobatto grid is much better behaved for polynomial interpolation than an evenly spaced grid. ) -->
<!-- Here ae some key ideas in polynomial interpolation. First, there are many cases where it is convenient to approximate a function $f$ with a sequence if polynomials $p_n$ of increasing order, with $p_n \to f$. That is actually what is done with the pseudospectral method.  -->


  <p>
    Uniformly spaced interpolation points do cause lots of problems! Uniformly spaced nodes make polynomial interpolation ill-conditioned for any interpolation algorithm. Rounding errors can then grow exponentially. However, Chebychev points provide a good set of interpolation points because of how they are distributed throughout the interval $[-1,1]$.  Lloyd Trefethen has an excellent book that discusses interpolation over Chebychev points, <i>Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  We used SciPy's <span style="font-family: monospace;">BarycentricInterpolator</span>, which is based on a paper by Berrut and Trefethen (2004),  <i>Barycentric Lagrange Interpolation</i>.
  Barycentric interpolation is a stable algorithm with several interesting properties.
  It does not compute the coefficients of the interpolating polynomial.
  Given interpolating data $(x_i,y_i)_i$, the interpolator is initialized in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time and evaluated in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time.
  However, the initialization does not depend on the function data $y_i$, and so it is possible to update $y_i$ quickly.
  </p>



  <p>
    <!-- There is exponential convergence of of spectral coefficients $a_n$ for analytic functions (faster than $n^k$ for every $k$!). Slower convergence occurs when $f$ is not analytic.  -->
    The Chebychev interpolator in general has exponential convergence (faster than $n^k$ for every $k$).
    John Boyd has an excellent summary of these results, and discussions of related numerical methods, in his book <i>Chebychev and Fourier Spectral Methods</i>.
