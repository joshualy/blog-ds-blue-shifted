  <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
  <p> There is a sense in which interpolation, and producing a "best-fit" curve are similar processes. A few data points are available (sometimes many), a relationship is assumbed between two or more quantities, and a function is produced that generalizes the relationship beyond the given data points. Sometimes the data is known to be somewhat inaccurate (due to say measurement error) or is known to contain noise from some other source. Problems of interpolation occur when data is sparse but fairly accurate. Larger datasets with noise can often be studied by producing a 'best-fit'curve or performing a linear regression.
  </p>
  <p>Consider the data $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ plotted above. We will show how to determine the straight line $y = mx + b$ that best fits the data, using ordinary least squares. For each data point $x_i$ we can determine the corresponding $y$-coordinate on the straight line, $f(x_i) = mx_i + b$.

    <code>
      print(x)
      print(y)
      z = (x*y).return_attribute**2
